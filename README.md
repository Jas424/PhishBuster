PhishBuster is a Chrome browser extension that checks if a suspected website is an Amazon phishing link.

The browser extension checks if the site is hosted on a secure HTTPS page.
The extension checks if the site is using any TLS or SSL. If the site is not using HTTPS, the extension will give a “Phishing” alert on the user interface.
The extension compares the domain name of the suspected phishing link to the actual Amazon domain name (www.amazon.com). If the domain name is different or contains typos or misspellings, it will give a “Phishing” alert.
The extension performs a content analysis of the suspected website and compares it to the actual Amazon login link. If the fields, attributes, and values do not match, the extension will give a “Phishing” alert on the user interface.
